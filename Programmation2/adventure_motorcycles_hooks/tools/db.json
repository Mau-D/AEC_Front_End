          "description": "BMW is an industry staple when it comes to the manufacture of capable adventure bikes, and the company’s G310GS has more than enough utility to solidify its place on our list. The bike’s futuristic design, rambunctious orientation, and powerful liquid-cooled, single-cylinder 4-stroke engine are the epitome of hybrid rideability, thanks to its generous 313cc capacity. A six-speed constant-mesh gearbox and lightweight tubular steel frame ensure that the bike keeps up with its competition, however; bringing the adaptable cycle in-line with some of the genre’s more-powerful offerings."

Aside from winning an alarming number of overland races in its heyday, the XR650L boasts one of the most traditional designs in the industry, harkening back to square, and somewhat barbaric, classics from the 1970s and 80s. When it comes to performance, the bike utilizes a 644cc overhead-cam air-cooled engine, capable long-travel suspension, and a gear-driven counterbalancer to reduce vibrations during your ride, making it the quintessential dual-sport bike for on, and off the blacktop."
